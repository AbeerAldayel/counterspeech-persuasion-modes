## Overview

This repository contains the **persuasion-mode annotations** applied to two well-known counterspeech datasets, focusing on dialog-based hate speech responses. The goal is to analyze the rhetorical strategies (logos, ethos, pathos) used to counter online hate.

## Dataset Contents

The released files include:

- `annotations/` ‚Äì CSV files with persuasion-mode labels for each utterance

Note: We release persuasion **label data** associated with each turn ID. Refer to the original datasets for further information related to the conversation from **DialogConan** (Bonaldi et al., 2022) and **ContextCounter** (Albanyan, Hassan, & Blanco, 2023), as indicated in the source-of-data column.

- **Reason**  
  Represents *logos* ‚Äì logical appeals using evidence, examples, or reasoning.

- **Credibility**  
  Represents *ethos* ‚Äì appeals based on personal experience or authority of the speaker.

- **Emotion**
