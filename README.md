## Overview

This repository contains the **persuasion-mode annotations** applied to two well-known counterspeech datasets, focusing on dialog-based hate speech responses. We provide a coarse-grain examination of the persuasion modes used in hate speech and counterspeech based on emotion, reason, and credibility.

## Dataset Contents

The released files include:

- `annotations/` ‚Äì CSV files with persuasion-mode labels for each utterance

Note: We release persuasion **label data** associated with each turn ID. Refer to the original datasets for further information related to the conversation from **DialogConan** (Bonaldi et al., 2022) and **ContextCounter** (Albanyan, Hassan, & Blanco, 2023), as indicated in the source-of-data column.

## Label Definitions

Each utterance is labeled with modes of persuasion:

- **Reason**  
  This label indicates logos as a mode of persuasion. It appeals to the utilization of logic or reason (e.g., presenting related examples or supporting evidence).

- **Credibility**  
  Represents ethos as a mode of persuasion. It relies on the credibility or authority derived from the speaker‚Äôs personal experience.

- **Emotion**  
  Represents pathos as a mode of persuasion. It evokes the emotions and feelings of the audience or puts them in a certain mood, appealing to their emotions.
